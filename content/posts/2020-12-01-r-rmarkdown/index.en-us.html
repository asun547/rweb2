<h1>Who?</h1>
<p>The name is Aman for most and Sunny for some. Water Resource Engineer with a passion for coding, data analytics, machine learning and spatial data analysis. I have a PhD in Environmental and Water Resources Systems from Cornell University. Technically my PhD focused on the application of system analysis (optimization, modeling,statistical, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis) and high performance computing tools (parallel processing) for cost-effective, robust solutions for environmental problems. Simply put I worked on methods to efficiently mimic reality using computers for choosing best option and evaluate alternative scenarios.</p>
<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>Just for fun. I think this might my introvertive way of expressing but lets see where it goes</p>
<h1>What?</h1>
<p>This collection is going to range from my personal views, life experiences to data analytics journey. Hopefully something interesting, useful and smile worthy comes out of this.</p>
<p>You can embed an R code chunk like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(cars)
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
fit &lt;- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = dist ~ speed, data = cars)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)        speed  
##     -17.579        3.932</code></pre>

<h1>Including Plots</h1>
<p>You can also embed plots. See Figure <a href="#fig:pie">1</a> for example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c(&#39;Sky&#39;, &#39;Sunny side of pyramid&#39;, &#39;Shady side of pyramid&#39;),
  col = c(&#39;#0292D8&#39;, &#39;#F7EA39&#39;, &#39;#C4B632&#39;),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)</code></pre>
